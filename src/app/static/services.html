<h4>Check Quality</h4>
<p>A quality control tool for high throughput sequence data.</p>
FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.

<div>
The main functions of FastQC are
<ul>

<li>Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)</li>
<li>Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems</li>
<li>Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data</li>
<li>Export of results to an HTML based permanent report</li>
<li>Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without running the interactive application</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h4>Align</h4>
<p>Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome. BWA-MEM algorithm is used for alignment in SciClone.</p>

See <a href="http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/">Burrows-Wheeler Aligner</a> for more information.
